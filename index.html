<h2 id="technologies-and-skills">Technologies and Skills</h2>
<p>I've used a variety of technologies and programming languages, but here I highlight a few and describe what I've used them for in work and play. For any language or technology I probably have &quot;strong opinions weakly held&quot; about what's great and awful about them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Python</dt>
<dd><p>I've used python at just about every company for scripting as well as systems coding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Authored devtools and simple but helpful build components, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/sqrl/packrat">packrat</a> which we used internally at WibiData to cache and share build artifacts.</li>
<li>Worked on large Python-based backend systems such as Dropbox's Python based blockstore service and our 'Drone' job scheduler for Hadoop jobs.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Java</dt>
<dd>I am experienced in coding distributed applications and map-reduce programs in Java. For example, it's what I use primarily at Dropbox for our new Data APIs written as DropWizard applications.
</dd>
<dt>Hadoop Stack</dt>
<dd><p>I've used a variety of technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem for model training and analytics: MapReduce, Yarn, HBase, Hive, Scalding, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ported Wibi's ecosystem to different versions of the Cloudera Distribution of Hadoop and others, dealing with the bugs and changes along the way.</li>
<li>Debugged numerous grungy issues in HBase ecosystem, such as ZooKeeper references, unblocking coworkers.</li>
<li>Put in yet more grunge-work hours on Dropbox's giant Hive cluster, migrating namenodes on a live cluster, debugging subtle Zookeeper locks, etc.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Scrum and hygienic coding</dt>
<dd><p>I was one of the first scrum masters at WibiData. Everyone does it differently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Led Sprint Planning for Wibi's platform team, working with Product to prioritize tasks.</li>
<li>Established much of our culture of code reviews, tooling, etc.</li>
<li>Owned the effort on writing our Python style guide.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Go-lang and Rust</dt>
<dd>Still learning these technologies, but I'm really excited about their potential. * Currently re-implementing Dropbox's legacy and feature-creeped blockstore with a Go-based solution for reasons of performance, safety, and cleanliness. * Coded a number of silly slack bots to practice Go and Rust: * https://github.com/sqrl/slack-quoter Bot to save and replay humorous slack quotes * https://github.com/hyena/professor_sloak Bot that gives people random pokemon on request, fortune cookie style. * https://github.com/sqrl/slack-logger Super simple bot that logs slack conversations
