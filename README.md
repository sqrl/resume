# Resume

This is my resume, written using markdown. The idea is based off of http://blog.chmd.fr/editing-a-cv-in-markdown-with-pandoc.html

You're probably interested in the .pdf or .html version.

# Notes to self
  * You may need to use wkhtmltopdf version 0.12.3 for proper space rendering. 0.12.4 does weird things
